# Director Style Modules

Style overlays used by the main `cinematic-director` skill. Each file is a coherent lens — narrative tendencies, camera grammar, lens kit, lighting, palette, editing rhythm, sound, performance, a machine-readable parameter block, a transferable shot checklist, prompt templates, and a worked example — that overrides defaults in the main workflow when the user asks for an "in the style of X" treatment.

These are **reference modules**, not standalone skills. The host agent never loads them on its own. The main skill pulls exactly one in at Step 4 (Style lens selection) when a style is named.

> Usage rule: these files describe high-level methods only. Do not copy specific shots, lines, characters, plots, or other copyrighted expression from any director's actual films. Use them to inform original work.

## Module structure

Every module follows the same section order, so switching lenses is a diff and adding one is a template fill:

```markdown
## 一句话镜头 / Lens in one line              # bilingual, 20 words or fewer each
## 适用场景                                   # when to reach for it
## 反例：这不是什么 / What this lens is NOT     # the adjacent styles it gets confused with
## 核心风格关键词
## 叙事方法
## 镜头语言
## 灯光与色彩
## 剪辑节奏
## 声音与音乐
## 人物与表演
## 风格参数 / Style parameters                # machine-readable YAML override block
## 可迁移拍摄清单                              # 6-8 checkable imperatives
## 提示词模板 / Prompt templates               # 中文 brief (Steps 5/7) + EN i2v (Step 10) + EN keyframe (Step 8)
## 落地示例 / Worked example                   # the shared control scene, this lens
```

Two sections carry most of the practical weight:

- **反例 / What this lens is NOT** names the adjacent style each director gets confused with and states the mechanical difference. Kubrick and Fincher are both cold and controlled — one presses people into architecture with a wide lens and one-point perspective, the other isolates them as specimens with long-lens compression. That distinction is what makes an overlay produce a different film rather than a different adjective.
- **风格参数 / Style parameters** is a YAML block the main skill reads directly: lens kit in mm, preferred and forbidden camera moves, motion budget, shot-size bias, composition patterns, key quality and ratio, palette, average shot length, transition bias, sound policy, performance register, aspect bias, AI clip duration and prompt bias, and the negative-prompt additions that style requires.

Every module ends by directing the **same** control scene — a person stands at a closed apartment door holding something they intend to give away, hesitates, and leaves without knocking — so the twenty files can be read side by side as twenty answers to one question.

## See it in action

[example_comparisons.md](example_comparisons.md) takes a single scene and treats it under eight lenses back to back, with a matrix of what each one changes and a "choosing a lens" table covering all twenty. Load it at Step 4 whenever a lens has to be chosen — the user named two directors, or named none and wants to see what an overlay concretely buys. Every figure in it is quoted from a module; where they disagree, the module wins.

## How the main skill uses these

1. The user names a director or asks for "in the style of X" — or supplies one via `project.director_style` in the intake schema.
2. The main skill loads exactly one file and applies its `风格参数` block as the override set for:
   - Step 5 (Director's book): lens policy, camera grammar, lighting, palette, editing rhythm, sound, performance
   - Step 7 (Shot list): preferred shot families, camera moves, average shot length, aspect bias
   - Step 8 (Keyframe strategy): palette, key ratio, composition patterns, negative-prompt additions — every module ships a `Keyframe / still prompt` template, and the still is where the lens is actually fixed
   - Step 10 (AI video prompt construction): prompt bias, clip duration, negative-prompt additions
3. Precedence is **director lens > genre playbook > project tone > skill defaults**.
4. If no director is named, the main skill uses [../genre-playbooks.md](../genre-playbooks.md) and the project's own tone.

Only one style is active at a time. If a user names two, pick the one that better serves the scene's dramatic core, say so in one line, and note what the other would have changed — [example_comparisons.md](example_comparisons.md) exists to make that comparison in one read.

## Adding a new style

Create `NN_<slug>.md` in this directory using the section structure above, with a complete `风格参数` YAML block and the shared worked-example scene. Then register it in `SKILL.md` (frontmatter description, intake enum, Step 4 list), the table above, and the top-level `README.md` tables. Add an eval case that proves the overlay changes camera, palette, pacing, or sound versus the unstyled baseline, plus a copyright-safety assertion. Full instructions: [../../CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

The numbered prefix controls sort order; pick the next available number.

Three conventions the twenty existing modules already follow, so a new one does not have to be special-cased:

- **`S` is reserved.** `S1`–`S4` mean the four prompt shapes in [../ai-video-tool-adapters.md](../ai-video-tool-adapters.md) and nothing else. Number the shots in a worked example `SH1`, `SH2`, … and any generation chain `CH1`, `CH2`, …
- **Keep the three prompt-template labels verbatim** — `镜头设计简报（中文，用于 Step 5 导演本与 Step 7 分镜）：`, `Image-to-video motion prompt（英文，用于 Step 10，接关键帧）：`, `Keyframe / still prompt（英文，用于 Step 8，接图像模型）：` — so a reader can tell at a glance which pipeline step each block feeds.
- **Restate the composition rule for 9:16 where the signature depends on a wide frame.** If the lens leans on lateral ranks, extreme lateral symmetry, or a figure sized as a percentage of frame height at distance, add one bullet at the end of `镜头语言` beginning `竖幅（9:16）改写：` saying what the rule becomes vertically — never that it is abandoned — and point the `aspect_bias` line at it with a comment. Modules 04, 06, 11, 15, 16 and 19 carry one; the rest do not need it. The general vertical grammar is owned by [../cinematic-language.md](../cinematic-language.md).
